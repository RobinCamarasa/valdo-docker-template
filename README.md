# valdo-docker-example

PyTorch Example for the [Where is VALDO challenge](https://valdo.grand-challenge.org/).


| :warning: WARNING          |
|:---------------------------|
| We are currently modifying the submission method from [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to [singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html). This is the first working example of the configuration with Singularity however it lacks some documentation. If you encounter any issue while building and/or testing your singularity container or have any question concerning this working example feel free to contact [Robin Camarasa](mailto:r.camarasa@erasmusmc.nl). |
